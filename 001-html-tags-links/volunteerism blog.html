        <h1>MANILA, Philippines - Are you mad about instigating change?</h1>
        <p> From a simple outreach project in December 2009, youth organization I Am MAD has since touched the lives of 1,420 students in 32 areas across the Philippines.</p>
        <p> The organization holds retreats and leadership camps for children to make them realize their potential to create change in their communities.</p>
        <p>Christian Marx Rivero, I Am MAD co-founder, said:<p>

            <p>Our definition of change is the impact you have on yourself, how you are changed. Change really begins with yourself. When you are able to change yourself, that's what we can all change.</p>
            <p>This is why we encourage the youth to make a difference in their own simplest way, to create a difference in any way.</p>

    <h1>Fueled by volunteerism</h1>
    <p>I Am MAD functions purely out of volunteerism. The organization doesn't have it's own funds. "A big impact of I Am MAD is our volunteers. We have around 200 to 300 volunteers all over the country… Volunteers even pay to become part of the organization. The hearts of our volunteers are really what creates the change,” Rivero said.</p>
    <p>For I Am MAD, changing society takes one kid at a time. <b> – Rappler.com </b></p>
